# VectorOS - an Operating System

This is a 64-bit **operating system** project.

At present, it is in the early stage of development. What I want to do is to develop a streamlined kernel guided by **UEFI** and its supporting service program.

I will make it conform to *POSIX* specification as much as possible. It may be a bit like Unix/Linux, at least in some ways. But I will adopt a different design philosophy from them.

I think this will be a very good personal project for college students, just to understand the composition principle of the underlying hardware and operating system.

Maybe I will use it as my graduation project. That would be amazing, maybe.
